This repository contains the **Sales Analysis** project, which focuses on cleaning and analyzing sales data using SQL queries to derive actionable insights. The project is structured to showcase the complete data analysis process from cleaning to exploratory analysis.

## üìÇ Repository Contents
- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets in CSV format.
  - `sales_data3.csv`: The original dataset before cleaning.
  - `Final Cleaned_Sales_Datac1.csv`: The cleaned and processed dataset.
- `queries/`: Includes SQL scripts for analysis.
  - `Data Cleaning on sales data.sql`: SQL queries used for data cleaning.
  - `EDA.sql`: SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis.
- `documentation/`: Comprehensive PDF documents explaining the process and results.
  - `DATA CLEANING FINAL DOCUMENTATION.pdf`: Details the cleaning process with SQL queries.
  - `EDA Documentation..pdf`: Details the exploratory analysis process with SQL queries.
  - `THINGS_I_LEARNED_FROM_DATA_CLEANING_AND_EXPLORATORY_DATA_ANALYSIS[1].pdf`: Key insights and lessons learned from the analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Objectives
1. To clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
2. To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
3. To document the findings and share lessons learned for educational and collaborative purposes.

## üîç Key Insights
- *Product X contributed 35% of total revenue.*
- *Region Y showed a 20% growth in sales over the last quarter.*
