## 📂 Repository Contents
- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets in CSV format.
  - `sales_data3.csv`: The original dataset before cleaning.
  - `Final Cleaned_Sales_Datac1.csv`: The cleaned and processed dataset.
- `queries/`: Includes SQL scripts for analysis.
  - `Data Cleaning on sales data.sql`: SQL queries used for data cleaning.
  - `EDA.sql`: SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis.
- `documentation/`: Comprehensive PDF documents explaining the process and results.
  - `DATA CLEANING FINAL DOCUMENTATION.pdf`: Details the cleaning process with SQL queries.
  - `EDA Documentation..pdf`: Details the exploratory analysis process with SQL queries.
  - `THINGS_I_LEARNED_FROM_DATA_CLEANING_AND_EXPLORATORY_DATA_ANALYSIS[1].pdf`: Key insights and lessons learned from the analysis.

## 🛠️ Objectives
1. To clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
